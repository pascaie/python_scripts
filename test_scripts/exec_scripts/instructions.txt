How to run python script in a fast way

1) add the 'shebang' line at the top of your python script:
  #! python3

2) put the python script in a specific folder of your choice
  (note that the folder must remain fixed in time in order to keep the script working)

3) in the same folder, create a Windows batch file (.bat) with the following two lines of text:
  @py.exe C:<folder_path>\<python_script_name.py> %*
  @pause
  (to perform this step, you can simply open Notepad, write down the line, and save the file as a .bat file)

4) add the folder location to the Windows 'PATH' environment variable
  i) in the start menu, type 'edit the system environment variables'
  ii) in the newly open 'System Properties' window, select environment variables
  iii) in the system variables, search for 'PATH' and edit it by adding the folder PATH

5) now you can simply run your Python script by:
  i) from the cmd, write the script name (even without '.py') and press enter
  ii) from your desktop, press Win+R, type the script name (even without '.py') and press enter
